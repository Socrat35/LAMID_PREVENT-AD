# LORIS MRI Downloader for the open PREVENT-AD dataset


## 1. Description

Due to the size (~200 GB) of the imaging dataset of the open PREVENT-AD dataset, 
it is not possible to download the whole study’s imaging dataset via the browser. 
However, various ways to download the imaging dataset are provided in this repository. 
 
Users can choose one of the following tool to download the open PREVENT-AD images:
  - a Python script called `LAMID_PREVENT-AD.py`
  - Jupiter Notebook called `LAMID_PREVENT-AD.ipynb` 

See section 2 below for the installation steps required for the tools available in 
this repository.

## 2. Installation and Requirements

Requirements for the script:
- Python 3 or higher
- the following Python libraries: `getpass`, `json`, `requests`, `os`, `sys`, `getopt`
and `errno`. 

### Installation script (requires Ubuntu and sudo permission)

An install script is provided in this repository to install Python and all its dependencies.

Note that the script will only work on Ubuntu machines and requires sudo permission.

To run the install script:
```bash
sudo bash install_LAMID_PREVENT-AD.sh
```

### Manual installation

1. Install python 3 or higher with `pip`

2. To install the python libraries using `pip`, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install getpass
pip install json
pip install requests
pip install os
pip install sys
pip install getopt
pip install errno
```


## 3. Downloading the MRI from the open PREVENT-AD LORIS API

### 3.1 Using `LAMID_PREVENT-AD.py`

In order to download the images from the open PREVENT-AD LORIS API, run the following
command in the directory where you want the images to be downloaded:

`python LAMID_PREVENT-AD.py`

Note, by default the images will be downloaded in the current working directory. However,
if you wish to download the images in a different directory, you can specify it when 
running the script with the option `-o` as follows:

`python LAMID_PREVENT-AD.py -o %PATH_TO_DIRECTORY%`

with `%PATH_TO_DIRECTORY%` being replaced by the path to the directory where you want
the files to be downloaded in.



### 3.2 Using Jupiter Notebook

Open the Jupiter Notebook file `LAMID_PREVENT-AD.ipynb` in Jupiter
Notebook and execute the code in the notebook.



## 4. Organisation of the downloaded structure

Below is a screenshot of the organization of a subset of the downloaded data.

![](images/data_organization.png)

All images are organized by candidate’s DCCID and visit labels. Note that the DCCID 
is the 7 digit candidate ID available in Browser module described in section 1. 

After completion of the download, the directory with the open PREVENT-AD data should 
contain 232 candidate folders. 
* Within each candidate folders, a `candidate.json` file with basic demographic 
information (Gender, Language, etc.) and several visit folders can be found.
* Within each visit folder of a given candidate, a `session.json` file, MINC images and 
QC information (in a JSON file) are available for each modality acquired during the MRI session. 
  * All MINC images are labelled as follows: `preventad_DCCID_VisitLabel_ScanType_ScanNumber.mnc`.
    More details about the MINC format can be found at 
    https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MINC/SoftwareDevelopment/MINC2.0_File_Format_Reference 
  * The QC information JSON file of a given MINC has the same name as the MINC file 
    associated with the QC information with `.qc.json` added at the end of the image name. 
    This JSON file contains image QC information (QC Status, Caveats, etc.)
  * The `session.json` information file contains information pertinent to the session 
    (Age at MRI, Subproject, etc.)
